The first impression looks to be the most important one. Thats what the _About_
page is for.

I don't have time currently to write an extensive [about](/about) page, but I added my curriculum and use the sidebar for the most relevant information.

At some point in future I will update my _About_ page following the guide of [Tracie Forbes](https://traciefobes.com/how-to-write-an-about-me-page/).
